=Server Side OSGi=
This project contains the minimum set of components needed to run OSGi in the server. Follow the instructions to create a deployable war file.

==Deployment==
Clone this repository in Eclipse and checkout the two projects. Then import the CVS project that are declared in the equinox.server.psf file. 
This can be done by right-clicking the PSF file and selecting Import Project Set ...

* Open the product file and click '''Eclipse Product export wizard'''. 
* Specify WEB-INF for the directory, uncheck "Synchronize before exporting" and enter "c:\somedir\remainsoftware.war" in the "Destination" "Archive file" text box. 
* Press Finish.
* Start tomcat and deploy the war file. 

If you have kept the defaults then the webpage should be available here [http://localhost:8080/remainsoftware/remain/software http://localhost:8080/remainsoftware/remain/software]. If you did not keep the defaults then I assume you know your way.

If your product can not be deployed because of a dependency problem, then try to install or check-out the missing bundles.

Have fun and drop me a line with your comments
